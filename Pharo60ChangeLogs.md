#Pharo 6.0 

A large, international community of developers worked hard for several months to iron out all problems and to make Pharo 6.0 a great release. Pharo 6.0 saw a large set of changes, infrastructural improvements and others: more than [NUMBER] tickets got closed. Our actions are targeted at building a sound infrastructure on top of which new generation of systems can be built.  
Remember that Pharo is your open-source system!

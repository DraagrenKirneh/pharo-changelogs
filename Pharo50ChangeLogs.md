#Pharo 5.0 

A large, international community of developers worked hard for several months to iron out all problems and to make Pharo 5.0 a great release. Pharo 5.0 saw a large set of changes, infrastructural improvements and others: more than [NUMBER] tickets got closed. Our actions are targeted at building a sound infrastructure on top of which new generation of systems can be built.  
Remember that Pharo is your open-source system!

In addition, many changes have been made to support the generation of a more modular system. 
This release integrates a quite large number of fixes and enhancements you can find at [FogBugz issue tracker](https://pharo.fogbugz.com) (you will need an account there, sorry). Thank you all for your contribution.
